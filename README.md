# sofle_keyboard_layout
My layout for the sofle keyboard, will eventually update this with a screenshot of the layout.

## Things I want to change or add:

### Macros:

Use the documentation on QMK's site for this, looks relatively easy to accomplish.

#### Shortcut for folding code to definitions:
- CMD+ALT+-
- Command should be something like `SendString(SST(CMD)SST(ALT)"-")m`

### Key Layout Changes:

- Flip the location of () and []

### Other Changes:

- Change out the `XXXXX` Key codes for `KC_NO`
- Change out `_____` for `KC_TRNS`

These are not necessariy changes and might make the key map more difficult to read.

## Other Ideas:
Should I hard code things like shrug, look of disapproval, tflip, and the various other text expansion thigns I use? I'm thinking these aren't the best ideas and will use up some of the keys I have left.
